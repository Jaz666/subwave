// Segment-director agent.
//
// The 5-minute cron (scheduler.skillsTick) calls agenticTick(), which hands a
// tool-loop agent a snapshot of the moment (what's on air, what the DJ said
// recently) plus real-world data tools (llm/segment-tools.js) and asks one
// question: is there anything worth saying between tracks right now? The agent
// may check the weather, headlines or artist news, then writes ONE spoken line
// or stays silent.
//
// It is deliberately NOT given the track-pick session history: that is mostly
// "pick the next song" chatter, which small models latch onto and start
// reasoning about music instead of the segment decision. The anti-repeat context
// it needs is queue.getDjRecap() — what actually aired.
//
// `runCapability()` is the /dj/skill manual override: the same tool-loop forced
// to one capability with cooldowns bypassed. The capability registry is loaded
// by skills/loader.js from state/skills/<slug>/ (built-ins seeded on first boot
// from src/skills/builtins/); this module consumes it via allCapabilities and
// backs the admin catalogue via skillCatalog(). The skill modules left in this
// directory are pure fetch helpers behind station-services.
//
// Guard rails the autonomous tick cannot talk its way past (the operator
// override bypasses all of them — when the operator asks, they get a segment):
//   - per-kind hard cooldown (from each skill's SKILL.md)
//   - a frequency-derived floor on the gap between ANY two segments
//   - capabilities the operator disabled, or the on-air persona doesn't own,
//     are never offered
//   - commute-only skills (via `window: commute`) air only during commute hours;
//     search-backed skills (web-search, now-playing-dig) only with a provider
