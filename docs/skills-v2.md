# Built-in skills v2: design notes

This document records the intended direction for opt-in successors to Subwave's
seven established built-in skills. It is a design reference, not a promise that
all seven must ship together.

## Shared rules

- Keep every established built-in unchanged. Each successor ships under its own
  `*-v2` name, disabled by default while it is evaluated.
- A shipped v2 skill must work without asking the operator for another account,
  API key or environment secret.
- Factual speech must cross the tool boundary as explicit, source-bound claims.
  Empty, ambiguous or failed research results produce silence rather than model
  improvisation.
- A completed research attempt consumes the skill's cooldown even when nothing
  airs. Infrastructure failures may retry sooner.
- Source retrieval, matching and rejection belong in shared services and pure
  helpers. `SKILL.md` owns presentation; it must not compensate for uncertain
  data with extra prompt rules.
- The Rehearsal Room should eventually be able to replay the tool result and
  Persona delivery separately, including the reason an item was rejected.

## Proposed skills

### Album anniversary v2

**Problem:** the established tool uses the current track's plain `year`. That
may be a reissue year, and the tool does not exclude compilations, singles, EPs
or other non-album releases.

**Data boundary:** resolve the on-air track's `albumId` through OpenSubsonic and
read `originalReleaseDate`, `releaseTypes` and `isCompilation` from the album.
These are already keyless fields on the station's configured music server.

**Acceptance:** require an original release year, `isCompilation !== true`, and
a release type that identifies an album while rejecting compilation, single,
EP, remix, mixtape and DJ-mix types. If the server does not provide enough
metadata to establish those facts, stay silent. Calculate the anniversary from
the station-local calendar year and retain the existing five-year interval.

**Speech:** one sourced anniversary observation. Do not infer chart performance,
importance or contemporary reception.

### Curiosity v2

**Problem:** the Wikimedia on-this-day lookup is already useful and filtered,
but the established brief permits unsourced fallback generation when the lookup
is empty.

**Data boundary:** retain the keyless Wikimedia on-this-day feed, its cultural,
scientific and sporting filters, and the durable dedup ledger.

**Acceptance:** only an explicit returned event may air. An empty feed or an
exhausted daily pool stays silent. Remove the LLM-generated factoid fallback.

**Speech:** preserve the current light, oddly specific delivery. This is a
safety revision rather than a creative redesign and is therefore low priority.

### Library deep-cut v2

**Problem:** the established tool scans only the first eight albums returned for
the artist, takes the first cold tracks it encounters and reports that bounded
sample as a count. The result is biased by server ordering and can feel like a
tease with no editorial purpose.

**Data boundary:** query Subwave's complete indexed library and play history for
the exact on-air artist. Select one track that has never aired or has genuinely
fallen out of rotation; exclude the current track and preferably the current
album. Return its exact title, album and last-air status.

**Acceptance:** only run when one unambiguous candidate exists. Never promise it
will play unless a future feature actually puts it into the queue.

**Speech:** frame it as something still worth rediscovering in the station's
own shelves. This remains the lowest-priority v2 candidate until it has a clearer
on-air purpose; a future Rehearsal Room or operator action could make it more
useful than an autonomous tease.

### News v2

**Problem:** the established skill reads one operator-configured general feed.
It cannot provide a default music-news beat or provenance-bearing headlines
shared with artist research.

**Data boundary:** use a cached, keyless RSS service. Keep BBC as the general
news source and add a small fixed set of public music feeds. Preserve headline,
publication, article URL and publication time; descriptions are discovery aids,
not factual material for the speaking model.

**Acceptance:** alternate between a suitable general headline and a music
headline when both pools have fresh items. If the preferred pool has nothing
safe, use the other rather than forcing an item. Deduplicate across feeds and
across previous airtime. Continue when an individual feed is unavailable.

Music headlines also pass an editorial relevance gate. When the active show has
configured genres, the headline must explicitly name an artist that can be
matched to the local library, and that artist's library genres must overlap the
show genres using Subwave's existing genre matcher. Apply this regardless of the
show's `filtersStrict` setting: the gate protects spoken editorial relevance,
not track selection. If a show has no configured genres, use the current track's
library genres as a soft relevance fallback; a genuinely broad unfiltered show
may use the full music-news pool. An unidentified or untagged headline is not
evidence of relevance and should be rejected. If no music item passes, use a
suitable general headline or stay silent.

**Speech:** conversational rather than a bulletin. Retain the established
avoidance of death, disaster and other stories unsuited to a breezy aside.

### Now-playing dig v2

**Problem:** general search snippets encouraged plausible but unsupported track
stories. Rejected attempts also retried every scheduler tick because cooldown
began only when speech aired.

**Current direction:** exact artist/title matching against MusicBrainz, with
source-bound first-release, producer, mixer and remixer claims. A completed
lookup consumes cooldown; missing evidence stays silent. The Persona may add a
brief subjective reaction, but no second factual assertion.

**RSS extension:** accept a music-feed headline only when the headline itself
explicitly names both the current artist and exact track title. An artist-only
match is current artist news and belongs to Web search v2.

**Later candidates:** writers and sample relationships require following
additional MusicBrainz entities and must receive separate exact-match tests
before becoming claims. B-sides need release/medium semantics and must not be
inferred from neighbouring track order.

### Weather v2

**Problem:** the established tool sees current conditions only and its brief
explicitly forbids forecasting. It cannot warn listeners about a meaningful
change later in the day.

**Data boundary:** extend the existing keyless Open-Meteo request with a bounded
hourly outlook. Derive a compact next-change result in code rather than passing
an hourly table to the model.

**Acceptance:** surface either a genuine change since the last weather mention
or the next significant change within a limited horizon. Significant changes
include rain or snow beginning/ending, a major condition transition, or a useful
temperature movement. Ordinary persistence (for example, remaining cloudy)
stays silent. Cache with the existing weather response and use station-local
times.

**Speech:** one or two in-character sentences. Use broad timing such as "later
this afternoon" unless the forecast supports a useful, stable time window.

### Web search v2

**Problem:** the established tool passes general answer and snippet text to the
model, allowing neighbouring search results to become invented artist facts. It
also requires a usable search provider even when a public music feed could have
answered the artist-news use case.

**Data boundary:** check the shared music RSS cache first. A headline qualifies
only when it explicitly names the current artist. Preserve its source and date
as evidence and never promote the article description into a claim.

**Fallback:** when RSS has no match and the operator already has a usable search
provider, issue the existing trusted-domain query and apply the same headline
and artist-name checks. RSS remains fully functional without SearXNG or a paid
search API.

**Speech:** one current artist update based only on the selected headline. Do
not infer tour locations, collaborations, quotations or release details absent
from that headline.

## Suggested implementation order

1. Finish and live-test Now-playing dig v2.
2. Build the shared music RSS cache and use it for News v2 and Web search v2.
3. Correct Album anniversary v2 using OpenSubsonic album metadata.
4. Add Weather v2's bounded look-ahead.
5. Make Curiosity v2 evidence-only.
6. Revisit Library deep-cut v2 only after defining a stronger on-air purpose.
